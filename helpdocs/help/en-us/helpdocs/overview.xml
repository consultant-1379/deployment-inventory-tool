      The primary purpose of the Deployment Inventory Tool (DIT) is to manage, store, retrieve and
      upgrade SED documents for all vENM and cENM test environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the large number of vENM test environments and to allow automation and tooling to be
      built around the management of them, the structure of each vENM SED and cENM SED is stored in a JSON
      Schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      These JSON Schemas allow DIT to manage the large number of SED documents that need to be
      stored and upgraded on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Openstack Auto-Deployment Tool (OADT) is used to automate manual steps in the vENM
      installation procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, DIT is used to store information relating to OpenStack Clouds (Pods) and
      Tenancies (Projects) as well as documents unrelated to ENM.
